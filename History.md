## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `kubevirt_memory_overhead` (default `512Mi`) and `kubevirt_memory_request` options.
  The VM spec now sets `spec.template.spec.domain.resources.requests/limits.memory`
  explicitly (guest + overhead for the limit) so Windows guests no longer get
  OOMKilled by KubeVirt's too-small auto-computed virt-launcher overhead.
- `wait_for_vm_ready` now inspects the virt-launcher pod each poll and fails
  fast with a specific reason (OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff,
  terminal VMI phase, ...) instead of hanging for the full timeout.
- TCP `readinessProbe` on the guest's SSH port is added to the VM spec by
  default (for `port-forward` and `nodeport` network modes; skipped for
  `multus`). `wait_for_vm_ready` now waits for the VMI's `Ready` condition to
  flip to `True`, so provisioning only hands off to Beaker once sshd is
  actually accepting connections — no more SSH "connection refused" retries
  while cloud-init / Windows first-boot is still running. Tunable via
  `kubevirt_readiness_probe` and opt-out via `kubevirt_readiness_probe_disabled`.
  When the probe is enabled, `timeout` is auto-raised to fit the probe's
  failure budget.
- Initial implementation of KubeVirt hypervisor provider for Beaker
- Support for VM provisioning using KubeVirt VirtualMachine objects
- Multiple image source support (PVC, ContainerDisk, DataVolume)
- Cloud-init configuration injection for VM setup
- Multiple networking modes:
  - Port-forward (default, works in all environments)
  - NodePort (requires node access)
  - Multus (external bridge networking)
- Automatic VM lifecycle management (provision, test, cleanup)
- SSH key injection and access setup
- Resource configuration (CPU, memory)
- Kubernetes authentication support (token, client certificates)
- Comprehensive test suite and examples

### Security
- SSH public key authentication by default
- Secure handling of Kubernetes credentials
